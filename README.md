# The Abyss

The Abyss is a voxel style sandbox engine built using C++ and OpenGL. It aims to be a heavily optimized voxel engine with more modern capabilities than that of the traditional "Minecraft" engine. Examples of additional capabilities include real time cascaded shadow mapping and infinite terrain generation in all 6 cardinal directions.

It is currently in development in a Linux environment. Windows cross compiling is also implemented.
